# OuchMod
- A mod for Weave that says "ouch" in chat each time you take damage.
- Written almost entirely by AI! (As a proof of concept)

## How to use
1. Download the latest [Weave Loader](https://github.com/Weave-MC/Weave-Loader/releases)
2. Download the latest [Lunar Launcher Inject](https://github.com/Nilsen84/lunar-launcher-inject/releases)
3. Add both files to their own directory and ensure they are the only files inside, and with lunar fully closed open Lunar Launcher Inject.
